# dogdatabase
This is a personal project in which I practice using Node.js among the other frameworks which include: Express, Mongoose, and Validator. This project is also connected to my MongoDB Atlas database. 

The purpose of this project is to explore Backend technologies using Node.js and create a RESTful API. 

In this project, it is purely server-side only.
